              This year there will be several projects in different fields of
              astronomy / astrophysics / technology. Teams are going to be
              assembled according to students' fields of interest. The current
              list of our team leaders with their projects is available here:

                    <strong>Denis Vida: Croatian Meteor Network - data analysis</strong>
                    <br>
                    Abstract: Croatian Meteor Network (CMN) is currently monitoring
                    the night sky over Croatia and near surroundings with 30 paired
                    cameras that enable precise trangulation of detected meteors and
                    their orbit determination. There has been an ongoing effort of
                    CMN to produce an automated, scientifically meaningufull,
                    photometric analysis of detected meteors as well. Recently, it
                    has been observed that light-curves of detected meteors display
                    large amplitude and high frequency intensity variations as the
                    meteor passes through it's brightest phase. These intense brightness
                    variations could possibly be attributed to meteor's rotation.
                    <br>
                    It's the goal of this group to try and obtain light-curves of
                    meteors detected by CMN, analyse their frequency spectrum and
                    try to determine their rotation rates.

                    <strong>Vasilije Perovic, Marta Niki&#263;:
                        Geophysical observatory - ELF Observations of Ionosphere</strong>
                    <br>
                    <span>
                        Abstract: The main instrument at Tican Geophysical Station is
                        Schumann antenna which is used to observe Ionosphere at Extremely
                        Low Frequencies and one of the main goals is detection of ELF EM
                        waves during meteor showers. Theoretical models predict these signals
                        but they have never been observed before. Observations were
                        successfully started recently and the system was automated. In
                        order to produce quantitative results, an absolute calibration of
                        Schumann antenna is required. Trivial and simple methods fail at
                        ELF since antenna length cannot be matched with the wavelength.
                        The goal of this group is to design a system for calibration and
                        perform the calibration on the Schumann antenna. Students will
                        gain knowledge and experience in antenna design and RF electronics
                        as well as data processing and analysis. Students will learn to use
                        LabView and MATLAB to perform these. There is also ample scope to
                        contribute to the development of the LabView code controlling the
                        observations as well as further automation.
