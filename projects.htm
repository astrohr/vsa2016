                  This year there will be several projects in different fields of
                  astronomy / astrophysics / technology. Teams are going to be
                  assembled according to students' fields of interest. The current
                  list of our team leaders with their projects is available here:

                        <br>
                        Abstract: Croatian Meteor Network (CMN) is currently monitoring
                        the night sky over Croatia and near surroundings with 30 paired
                        cameras that enable precise trangulation of detected meteors and
                        their orbit determination. There has been an ongoing effort of
                        CMN to produce an automated, scientifically meaningufull,
                        photometric analysis of detected meteors as well. Recently, it
                        has been observed that light-curves of detected meteors display
                        large amplitude and high frequency intensity variations as the
                        meteor passes through it's brightest phase. These intense brightness
                        variations could possibly be attributed to meteor's rotation.
                        <br>
                        It's the goal of this group to try and obtain light-curves of
                        meteors detected by CMN, analyse their frequency spectrum and
                        try to determine their rotation rates.

                        <strong>Vasilije Perovic, Marta Niki&#263;:
                            Geophysical observatory - ELF Observations of Ionosphere</strong>
                        <br>
                        <span>
                            Abstract: The main instrument at Tican Geophysical Station is
                            Schumann antenna which is used to observe Ionosphere at Extremely
                            Low Frequencies and one of the main goals is detection of ELF EM
                            waves during meteor showers. Theoretical models predict these signals
                            but they have never been observed before. Observations were
                            successfully started recently and the system was automated. In
                            order to produce quantitative results, an absolute calibration of
                            Schumann antenna is required. Trivial and simple methods fail at
                            ELF since antenna length cannot be matched with the wavelength.
                            The goal of this group is to design a system for calibration and
                            perform the calibration on the Schumann antenna. Students will
                            gain knowledge and experience in antenna design and RF electronics
                            as well as data processing and analysis. Students will learn to use
                            LabView and MATLAB to perform these. There is also ample scope to
                            contribute to the development of the LabView code controlling the
                            observations as well as further automation.
